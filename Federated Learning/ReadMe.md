There are currently three directories: communication, system and traing issues, which stores the potentially valuable papers.
As the directory name metioned, the Communication Issues dir includes the papers which lie in the interdiscpiline of federated learning (FL) and wireless communications (WC). 
All the system designed related papers are kept in the dir of System Issues. Meanwhile, we keep the FL algorithms training related papers in the folder of Training Issues.
The general knowledge and backgroud papers just keep in the home dir.
