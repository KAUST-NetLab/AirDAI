This is a system framework for the project of building federated learning algorithms in mobile edge network considering about QoSs.

In practical, we will make effort to realize the follwing requirements:
  1): Build a system model on the mobile edge network and wireless communication in context of current development of 5G and 6G.
  2): Realize the training of federated learning methods and alogothms.
  3): Evaluate our system by varifing the state-of-art of some common applications.
  4): A handbook-like paper organizes and concludes all the afforementioned functions.
